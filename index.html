    <h2>Ranks are not given, they are earned. Each rank comes with their own duties and tasks to complete. The Club runs like a machine, each rank imperative to how the club is maintained and functions; above all however, this is a family.

      Adhere to club hierarchy, this will insure structure when needed, and that respect is given to all - No matter if President or Prospect, respect should be given as earned. We are only as good as each other, equal in brotherhood.
